She spends her days wondering about gaps: the gap between generations, the gap between social/economic classes, and the gap between those who have the means to help others and those who are in need of help. While Nina is aware that none of her areas of focus are, strictly speaking, Public Health, she is very active in Public Health-related projects. She has spent a year as an intern with the Peer Empowerment Program for Physical Activity in Low Income & Minority Seniors (PEP4PA) and is currently a Life Course Scholar under the Urban Studies Planning department. She happily spends her free time  with her precious loved ones or with her face glued to her books, her sketchbook, or her Netflix screen.</p>

He is currently conducting an urban development project for his hometown community, Westlake, Los Angeles. He hopes to create a meaningful community development plan through a bottom-up approach and highlight the voices of residents from Westlake in their struggle against gentrification. Javier’s work fits into his larger research interest of race, politics, and uneven development. He aims to urge scholars to think about how politics and urban development is acted out at an everyday level and represent the stories of individuals often overlooked in the urban development process. Outside the academia, Javier loves to run. He is currently training for his 9th marathon in San Diego. He also loves photography, filming, and urban exploration.</p>

                            <p>Ashni Vora is a Biochemistry and Cell Biology student at UCSD. She hopes to someday find the cure for cancer, despite how cliche it sounds. She is passionate about helping people by any means available, and truly believes that an interdisciplinary approach is the best. She is a research intern at Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Research Institute, where she studies the use of transdifferentiation of cells as a cure for genetic disorders. In her free time Ashni likes to dive into research, whether it is finding the perfect grilled cheese recipe or uncovering the biochemical basis of spontaneous human combustion; her curiosity is the major motivation for most things in her life. On any given weekend you could find her exploring San Diego, hiking, eating brunch or most likely, sleeping in.</p>

I hope to develop my programming, design and communication skills as applied to the club - in addition to other skills I already possess but am again, vaguely aware of. The one thing I know for certain is that I am fortunate to possess a malleable mind that enables me to be creative, and generate new and surprising ideas (at least to me, they are). I hope to rely on this sole ability of mine to keep up with my (clearly) more interesting and qualified partners on this exciting project. In the long term I hope to promote a culture of self-sufficiency and sustainability among people of the world.</p>
